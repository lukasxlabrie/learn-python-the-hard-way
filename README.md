# Learn Python the Hard Way
This is my personal journey through *Learn Python the Hard Way* by Zed A. Shaw. I'll be documenting each exercise with code and notes, tracking my progress publicly as I build fluency in Python from the ground up.

## Goals
- Complete all exercises from the book  
- Write personal notes and reflections for each exercise  
- Practice clean, readable Python  
- Track progress using Git and GitHub  
## Tools Used
- Python 3  
- VS Code

## Motivation
This project is about consistency and mastering the basics—one exercise at a time. I'm not rushing. I'm documenting everything I learn so I can look back and measure growth.
