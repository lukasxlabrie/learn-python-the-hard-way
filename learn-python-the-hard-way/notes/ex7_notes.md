end is a parameter of the print() function.

It controls what gets printed at the end of the output.

By default, print() ends with a newline character (\n), which moves the cursor to the next line.

Common end values:

end='\n' → Default. Moves to a new line after printing.

end='' → No newline. Keeps the next print on the same line.

end=' ' → Adds a space instead of a newline.

end='***' → Adds custom text (in this case, "***") at the end of the printed output.
