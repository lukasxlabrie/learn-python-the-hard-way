input() waits for the user to type something and stores it as a string. Example: age = input()

print() normally ends with a new line. Using end=' ' keeps the cursor on the same line. Example: print("How old are you?", end=' '), strictly visual preference

f-strings insert variable values into a string using {}. Example: print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall, and {weight} heavy.")
