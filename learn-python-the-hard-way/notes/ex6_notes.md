Strings are usually exported from a program and meant to be read by someone.
Common practice is to use short abbreviiations for names
to insert a string into a print, you need to use f to create an f string 
print(fLike this {printThisToo} to me an fstring.")
There is also a .format, which will be eplained later but its used to borrow already exisitng formats which you can use in a loop, etc
