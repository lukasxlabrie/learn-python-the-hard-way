Reminder on debugging

1. Write comments to explain what you;re doinng
2. Read the code backwards to help isolate sections
3. Read the code outlouad

Variables are used to make code easier to read, names shuld be clear and help identify purpose

_ underscores are ok to sepreate words 

camelCase is what im used to so will lilkey use this

= is called eqauls, used to name data

Syntax exmaple:

variableOne = 1
variableString = ("This is a string of text")
