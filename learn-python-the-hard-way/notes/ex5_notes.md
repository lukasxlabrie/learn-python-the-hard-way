String is something in the program that might go to a human 
Strings are created using "" or ''

F strings AKA formatted strings use f which is for format
you refernce the string in {} to print it as is and not as a string

syntax example:
syntaxExample = "an example"
print(f"Here is how you would create {syntaxExample} using an embedded string.")

cannot use numbers alone.

Example:

1 = a

Can use:

a1= a

or

1a = a
