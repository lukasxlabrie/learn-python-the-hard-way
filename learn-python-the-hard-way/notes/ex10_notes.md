An escape sequence lets you insert special characters into strings that are otherwise hard to type, using a backslash (`\`) followed by a character.

Python Escape Sequences:

- `\\` — Prints a backslash (`\`)
- `\'` — Prints a single quote (`'`)
- `\"` — Prints a double quote (`"`)
- `\n` — New line (moves text to next line)
- `\t` — Tab (adds horizontal space)
- `\r` — Carriage return (moves to line start)
- `\b` — Backspace (deletes one character backward)
- `\f` — Form feed (new page — rarely used)
- `\v` — Vertical tab (vertical space — rarely used)
- `\a` — Bell sound (alert — rarely used)
- `\ooo` — Character by octal value
- `\xhh` — Character by hex value
- `\uXXXX` — Unicode character (16-bit)
- `\UXXXXXXXX` — Unicode character (32-bit)
- `\N{name}` — Unicode character by official name
